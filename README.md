University project on a sentimental analysis task
<br>
In recent years, mental health awareness has grown significantly, highlighting the importance of
understanding the factors contributing to mental well-being, particularly in the workplace.
This project aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to analyze mental health
trends across various professions using a two-pronged approach: training models on an existing
mental health dataset and applying these models to real-world data fetched from job-specific
subreddits.
We used the mental_health.csv dataset, which contains a collection of mental health-related
entries, each labeled as positive or negative in sentiment. Our primary objective was to develop
models capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of these entries. To achieve this, we
explored both training models from scratch and fine-tuning pre-trained models, conducting a
thorough analysis to determine the most effective approach for binary sentiment analysis on this
dataset.
After the training phase, we extended our research by scraping data from various job-related
subreddits. Each post within these subreddits was subjected to our sentiment analysis models to
identify trends in job-related anxiety and negative mental health impacts. By evaluating the
sentiment of these posts, we aimed to uncover which professions exhibit higher levels of job-
related stress and contribute to adverse mental health outcomes.
